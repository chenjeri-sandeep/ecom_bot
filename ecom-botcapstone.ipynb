Introduction: Problem & Solution\n\n### The Challenge of E-commerce Navigation\n\nModern online stores offer vast catalogs of products. For customers, navigating these extensive selections and finding exactly what they need can be overwhelming. Traditional keyword search often falls short when users have nuanced requirements or are unsure of specific product names. Companies also need efficient ways to help customers discover products and get detailed information without manual intervention.\n\n### Our Gen AI Solution: An Intelligent Product Agent\n\nThis notebook presents an intelligent e-commerce product assistant built using Google's Gemini Gen AI models, LangChain, and LangGraph. The agent acts as a conversational interface, allowing users to interact with the product catalog using natural language.\n\nThe agent is designed to:\n* Understand user queries about products.\n* Search the product catalog for relevant items.\n* Provide detailed information about specific products.\n* Offer personalized product recommendations based on user needs.\n* Manage a user's wishlist.\n* Handle broader questions about product types or technologies by searching the web.\n* Maintain context throughout the conversation.\n\nBy leveraging key Generative AI capabilities, this agent aims to enhance the online shopping experience, making product discovery more intuitive and engaging.\n\n## 2. Gen AI Capabilities Demonstrated\n\nThis project showcases the following core Gen AI capabilities as required by the competition guidelines:\n\n1.  **Agents:** We use LangGraph to orchestrate a multi-step process, allowing the LLM to decide on actions (like calling tools) based on the conversation state and manage the flow between different stages of interaction (human input, chatbot processing, tool execution).\n2.  **Function Calling:** The Gemini model is equipped with a set of predefined tools (`get_catalogue`, `get_product_details`, etc.), and the LLM uses its Function Calling ability to determine which tool is needed based on the user's request and generate structured calls to invoke them.\n3.  **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG):** For product recommendations, the agent employs a RAG pattern. It retrieves relevant product information from a vector database (ChromaDB) based on the user's query (Retrieval) and then uses the LLM to synthesize this information into a coherent recommendation response (Generation). This process also leverages **Embeddings** and **Vector Search/Store**.\n\nWe will demonstrate where each of these capabilities is implemented within the code sections below.\n\n## 3. Setup and Data Loading\n\nFirst, we install the necessary libraries and set up the environment, including retrieving the Google API key.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Remove

Conclusion\n\nThis project successfully demonstrates the power of combining Generative AI models (Gemini) with orchestration frameworks (LangGraph) and external data sources (ChromaDB for RAG, Google Search for web lookups) to create an intelligent, conversational agent. The agent leverages Agents, Function Calling, and RAG (including Embeddings and Vector Search/Store) to provide a natural language interface for exploring an e-commerce product catalog.\n\nThis agent serves as a robust foundation for building advanced conversational e-commerce assistants.","metadata":{}}]}
